//A Company manufactures Vehicles, which could be a Helicopter, a Car, or a Train depending on the customerâ€™s demand.
// Each Vehicle instance has a method called move, which prints on the console the nature of movement of the vehicle.
// For example, the Helicopter Flies in Air, the Car Drives on Road and the Train Runs on Track.
// Write a program that accepts input from the user on the kind of vehicle the user wants to order,
// and the system should print out nature of movement. Implement all Java coding best practices to implement this program.
